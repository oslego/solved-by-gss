        <p><strong class="q">Tell us about your path to becoming a musician.</strong> All of my formative years were spent in Colorado Springs: I moved there from the Bay Area when I was 11, right before the pivotal moment of entering the sixth grade. Music wasn’t a big part of my upbringing, but I sang along to Stevie Nicks, Diana Ross, Motown groups like the Four Tops, and gospel music that my mom played in the car. I was in choir in high school, and I bombed a couple talent shows. <em>(laughing)</em> I taught myself how to play instruments by fumbling around with an acoustic guitar and a shitty keyboard, and playing along to albums like Coldplay’s <em>A Rush of Blood to the Head</em>.</p>
        <p>I didn’t start playing music seriously until college, which was around 2008. I originally went to a small school in Chattanooga, Tennessee, to play soccer, but I fell out of that as a freshman. When I realized that I wasn’t going to have a career in sports, I decided to pursue music full-time. I didn’t think about being a musician professionally; I just wanted to devote myself to becoming better. My skills were pretty marginal at the time, so I started recording crappy songs in my dorm room and went from there.</p>
